<h1 class="text-xl text-red-700 font-bold">About</h1>
<p class="text-sm mb-4">The Society was formed by a group of people with a love of 'things Italian' in 1983 as an Italian language class. Social evenings were organised and after several years the classes died out but the social side flourished. We now meet monthly for talks, usually illustrated and always in English, on a variety of Italian topics. However, our Italian speaking members are always happy to help anyone wishing to speak the language.</p>
<p class="text-sm mb-4">We are a friendly group so if you are interested in art, cuisine, music, architecture, history or have enjoyed and Italian holiday come along to one of our meetings. No knowledge of Italy or the language is necessary and our meetings always end with a glass of wine.</p>
<p class="text-sm mb-4">Meetings are on the first Monday evening of the month in the Ann Rose Hall, Greyfriars Community Centre, Ringwood</p>
